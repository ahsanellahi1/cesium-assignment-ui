### Things to improve

I have spent more than the alotted time and there a few things i would like to improve in this project. Following are a few of them:

1. Clean up front end. Isolate CRUD logic using redux thunk and properly manage async api calls and move render logic to components and try to make them re-usable.
2. Responsive front end design.
3. Test cases are missing on front end.
